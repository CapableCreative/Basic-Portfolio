                    I (Stephen Fox) started working on the web in 2009 as a "web designer." These days, that title is outdated.
                    While I worked at my first job, User Experience positions became prevalent; when my company folded, I pivoted. Since then,
                    I've worked at United Methodist Communications to help bring several unweildy projects into alignment.
                </p>
                <p>Aside from my work on the web, I've worked as a published artist, and professional writer. Currently, I'm plotting my next
                    project â€” a comic called <b><strong>XL</strong></b>, about a 42 year old discovering what it means to be a "man" in 2019.
